# The UNOFFICIAL (but useful) Python client for the Rapid7 Insight Platform
This code was thrown together to faciliate the dumping of asset information from the Insight Platform. This is not supported for production use by myself or Rapid7. 

## Requirements
This client is dependent on [Selenium Client Driver](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/) and makes use of the [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).
